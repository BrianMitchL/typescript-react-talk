# typescript-react-talk

This was used for a lightning and then full-length talk in 2019. It has been updated to the latest dependencies, but the spirit should be the same as when originally built. See the [git tags](https://github.com/BrianMitchL/typescript-react-talk/tags) for the state of the repo when I gave a talk.

To get going, clone the repo and run

```shell
npm install
npm run start
```
